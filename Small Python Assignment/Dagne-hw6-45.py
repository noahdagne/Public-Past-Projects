# 4.)
# 6) start with function b and pass the value of Bill to it.lambda
# 7.function b first prints out "function b"
# 8.functiona is called passing the value of n (Bill) and it is set to q
# 9.functiona is called now in order to have a value for variable q
# 10.in function a, it first prints out "function a"
# 11.function a returns "Bill" + "!"
# 12.q now holds the value of "Bill" + "!"
# 13.function b then returns "Bill" + "!" + " " + "Bill" + "!"
# 14.That is what is printed out when print(functionb(n)) is called
#
# 5.) apples oranges
# 6.First import random to use later
# 7. Then create an empty string aassigned to variable "food"
# 8. Make a new shopping list that is empty
# 9. Create a while loop that keeps going until the user inputs "done"
# 10. Prompt the user to enter an item and done when finished. User enters apples.
# 11. It then adds the entered food item(apples) to the empty shopping list.
# 12. The while loop starts again and prompts the user to enter another
#     item and done when finished.
# 13. The user enters oranges so it adds oranges to the list "shopping_list" and now there are two items.
# 14. The program starts the while loop again and prompts the user for an item and done when finished.
# 15. The user types in done and the while loop stops.
# 16. variable "index" is created and it checks the length of the shopping list in order to count from its last index
# 17. Its last index is 1
# 18. The program at the end prints "I like", followed by orange first because it's the first index.' \
# 19. the code is done                                                                              ''
